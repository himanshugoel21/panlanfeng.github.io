  <span class="subtitle">PhD in Statistics</span>
</p>

I am currently PhD candidate in Statistics at Iowa State University under the direction of [Dr. Yehua Li](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~yehuali/). My research interests include High Performance Computing, False Discovery Rate Control, Clustering and Missing Data Analysis.

I completed my Master and Bachelor degree in Renmin University of China. My advisor of Master degree is Dr. Xiaoling Lu. My research was about data mining and matrix factorization at that time.

The programming languages I use most are R and Julia. I have been using R for 8 years and Julia for 4 years. I use R for plotting and reporting as well as small projects. When need to do heavy computing, I will turn to Julia for higher performance.

## Software Packages
* [`KernelEstimator.jl`](http://github.com/panlanfeng/KernelEstimator.jl).

<p style="padding-left:60px;">
 Implement kernel density estimation and kernel regression. In particular this package can deal with bounded kernel estimation using beta and gamma kernel and can choose bandwidth via cross valuation.
 </p>

* `LatentGaussianMixtureModel.jl`
<p style="padding-left:60px;">
Fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model with Gaussian mixture random effects and decide the number of components for Gaussian mixture. And further conduct a multiple test to detect heterogeneity while controlling the False Discovery Rate.
</p>

* [`RFlavor.jl`](http://github.com/panlanfeng/RFlavor.jl)
<p style="padding-left:60px;">
Implement a lot of useful and handy R functions in Julia. The purpose is to provide better statistical functions for Julia language as well as make it easy to translate R code into Julia.
</p>

* [`GaussianMixtureTest.jl`](http://github.com/panlanfeng/GaussianMixtureTest.jl)
<p style="padding-left:60px;">
Implement the Kasahara-Shimotsu Test to decide number of components in Gaussian Mixture Model.
</p>

* [`bignmf`](http://github.com/panlanfeng/bignmf)
<p style="padding-left:60px;">
R package to solve the nonnegative matrix factorization problem using coordinate descent.
</p>

* Contribute to [`Yeppp.jl`](http://github.com/JuliaMath/Yeppp.jl)
<p style="padding-left:60px;">
 Port the <a href="http://www.yeppp.info/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Yeppp!</code></a>
 library into Julia, significantly speeding up several basic arithmetic operations.
</p>

* Contribute to several core statistical packages in Julia community including  [`StatsBase.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaStats/StatsBase.jl), [`Rmath.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Rmath.jl), [`DataArrays.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaStats/DataArrays.jl) and [`KernelDensity.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaStats/KernelDensity.jl).
