I was encouraged to switch to Arch Linux these days. There were so many benefits according to advice givers.  I'm used to Ubuntu already and almost everything works fine on my ultrabook except for the screen DPI. It seems the DPI is set to 96X96 without possibility to change it unless hacking into the system and recompiling it. Well...

I'm not a geek who can spend weeks on configuring his system. I prefer to spend my time on some more intersting things. Being an expert on operating system doesn't sound attracting for me. I only need to have a good operating system to use. 

As a fake fan of open source softwares, I prefer easier way to get things done. OS X looks great after trying it on one  MAC, but I'm not sure 
I will keep liking it. If oneday there is some feature driving me mad and I couldn't change it, I will feel terrible because of the money I spent on it. 

This maybe the biggest reason for me to use Linux and other open source softwares.

P.S. I really like the windows picker, spotlight and finder on Mac. I found indicator-synapse, the Ubuntu version of spotlight. But I failed to find a handy file manager as finder. 


##Update

If I have enough money, I will buy a Macbook anyway.  

##Update July, 2015

I was too young too naive.
After my previous laptop had a hardware issue, I bought a Mac pro and it is great. 

After I found the windows shell [Babun](http://babun.github.io/), windows becomes adorable too.
