      <description>Many problems, such as some in Philosophy, are difficult because it is hard to state them clearly. A powerful language system improves people&amp;rsquo;s ability to solve complicated problems.
R is almost a statistics language. Sometimes it helps to think in R commands. For example, pnorm(2.5, 2, 4), qt(.975, 20) is more intuitive than mathematical notations. And by, *ply functions will help to think about matrix computations.
It is a good idea to melt programming language and mathematical language together.</description>
