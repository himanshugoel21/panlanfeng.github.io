## Education

## Research

  - Research Assistant, 2014-current  
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The project is evaluating the performance of certain health care facilities. In this project we propose generalized linear mixed model with Gaussian Mixture random effects. This method can deal with False Discovery Rate control problem when the facilities are very heterogeneous.</p>

  - First Place in the 15th Annual Data Mining Cup, May, 2014  
<p style="padding-left:60px;">One of the nine team members. The data was about online shopping. Task was predicting returning probability given a customers' shopping records and item information. </p>

## Software Packages

 - [KernelEstimator](https://github.com/panlanfeng/KernelEstimator.jl): Julia package implements kernel density estimation and kernel regression. In particular this package can deal with bounded kernel estimation using beta and gamma kernel and is able to choose bandwidth via cross valuation.
 
 - [GaussianMixtureTest](https://github.com/panlanfeng/GaussianMixtureTest.jl): Julia package implements the EM test on number of components of Gaussian Mixture Model. Deciding the number of components has been a long lasting issue until some recent papers. This package can be applied to False Discovery Rate control.

 - [Yeppp](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Yeppp.jl): Contributed to this Julia package. Load the [Yeppp!](http://www.yeppp.info/) library to speed up basic arithmetics such as `exp` and `log` in Julia. Since these two are very frequently used in calculating likelihood and can often be the bottleneck of performance, using this package can largely speed up statistical computing.
